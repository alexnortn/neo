/// In mathematics, a spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system for 
/// three-dimensional space where the position of a point is specified by three numbers: 
/// the radial distance of that point from a fixed origin, its inclination angle measured 
/// from a fixed zenith direction, and the azimuth angle of its orthogonal projection on 
/// a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith, 
/// measured from a fixed reference direction on that plane. 
/// 
/// The zenith direction is the up vector (0,1,0) and the azimuth is the right vector (1,0,0)
/// 
/// (From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system )
